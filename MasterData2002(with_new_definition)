###re-formatting###
# In order to make my data regression-friendly, I re-format my data set by household units. 
# Each row contains the child's schooling and his/her mother and father's schooling along with all control variables.

# First, I check for the member's relationship with the household head
mydata$relationship <- as.character(mydata$relationship)
sort <- rle(sort(mydata$relationship))
relationship <- data.frame(relationship=sort$values, frequency=sort$lengths)
list(relationship)
# Note that individuals younger than 22 are not included in the data set.
# The most common relationships are self, spouse, child and parent, which are incorporated in my study.
# The rest relationships are omitted.
# Note that although having a large frequency, child-in-law and parent-in-law are out of scope in my study. 

# Then I check for the number of children in the households
aggr <- aggregate(x=mydata["child"], by=list(household=mydata$HHID),FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
count <- rle(sort(aggr$child))
NumberChildren <- data.frame(NumberChildren=count$values, frequency=count$lengths)
list(NumberChildren)
# Note that zero children contains the case of which the household head lives with parents.
# I omitted the 7 three-children families in my final data set.


# Therefore, I group all household into three categories: one-child, two-children, hh-head-with-parents.
# one child: parents are matched by household code
# two children: each child enters in a separate row and their parents enter twice in the two rows.
# hh-head-with-parents ("self" and "parent" specified in the "relationship" column): "self" enters as the child and "parent" enters as the mother or father depending on their gender.
