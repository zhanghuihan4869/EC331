###re-formatting###
# In order to make my data regression-friendly, I re-format my data set by household units. 
# Each row contains the child's schooling and his/her mother and father's schooling along with all control variables.

# First, I check for number of children in the households
aggr <- aggregate(x=mydata["child"], by=list(household=mydata$HHID),FUN=sum, na.rm=TRUE)
count <- rle(sort(aggr$child))
NumberChildren <- data.frame(NumberChildren=count$values, frequency=count$lengths)
list(NumberChildren)
# So out of all households in the survey, there are 5308 households with 0 children, 1345 with 1 child, 175 with two children, and 7 with three children.
# note that individuals younger than 22 are not included in the data set.
# note that the case where the household has no children but the household head lives with parents is included in my data set.
# I omitted the 7 three-children families in my final data set.


# I group all household into three categories: one-child, two-children, hh-head-with-parents.
# one child: parents are matched by household code
# two children: each child enters in a separate row and their parents enter twice in the two rows.
# hh-head-with-parents ("self" and "parent" specified in the "relationship" column): "self" enters as the child and "parent" enters as the mother or father depending on their gender. 


# I use the sql package to help with data formatting
